# MIGRATED
This repository has been migrated to Codeberg and this repository will recieve no more updates in the future. Open all future issues and PRs there. 

`flite` itself remains maintaned at https://codeberg.org/tazz4843/flite-rs with no plans to discontinue it.

## Why'd you do this?
[This blogpost](https://skaye.blog/ai/ai-gitbail) is a good summary of my reasons. I recommend reading through it, but a tl;dr:
I don't want to deal with GitHub's new GenAI bullshit features that result in more work than they "save", on top of their questionable licensing for a public domain project such as `whisper-rs`.

I am opposed to GenAI and similar "tools". They do nothing besides wasting time and scarce natural resources that could be put to much better use otherwise.
